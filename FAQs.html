                <h2>General</h2>
                <h4>Is mednear a phermacy?</h4>
                <p>No, MedNear helps you connect to the partnered pharmacy that can fulfill your order. We partner with verified pharmacies, which work with registered pharmacists.</p>
                <h4>So, how will I get my medicines?</h4>
                <p>The prescription that you provide to us is validated by a team of pharmacists and is then passed on to a pharmacy in your vicinity. The sale of medicines can only be done by a licensed pharmacy under the supervision of a pharmacist.</p>
                <h4>How does my prescription get validated?</h4>
                <p>We check if a registered medical practitioner has generated the prescription. We then look at the date of visit and duration of medication, to check if the prescription has expired. We also check if the quantity of medicines ordered matches with the prescription.</p>
                <h4>If I upload a prescription, will my order be confirmed immediately?</h4>
                <p>No. After we validate the prescription, our vendor will then confirm the stock availability. We will send you a SMS, email and Push Notification, if we are unable to fulfill some medicines.
